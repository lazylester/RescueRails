Rails 5.2.x
Ruby 2.3.1
Postgresql 9.6.x

## About
RescueRails is the public facing website for Operation Paws for Homes, as well as the private system used by the rescue for managing dogs, adopters and staff.


## Developer Notes
### Setup in dev

    git clone git@github.com:ophrescue/RescueRails.git
    cd RescueRails
    bundle install

Create database.yml file, and use postgres

    rake db:setup
    rake db:seed

You're also going to need to setup the auto incrementor in postgresql on the dogs.tracking_id column.  Run these commands for both your development and test databases:

```
psql                                            //launch Postgresql command line
\list                                          //to get a list of your databases if you don't remember
\connect TheNameOfYourDatabase
CREATE SEQUENCE tracking_id_seq START 1;
\q                                              //quit and return to command prompt.
```

Fire up the app and see what happens.  App is setup to run SSL always, might want to use POW as your webserver in dev.

See `db/seeds.rb` for default admin login info

### Running Tests

Tests are run via Headless Chrome, which will require Google Chrome and ChromeDriver.

```
brew install chromedriver
```
